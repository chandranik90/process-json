# process-json
All .json files within specified directory and subdirectories recursively will be processed one by one.

If no arguments are specified for process_JSON.py script, then current working directory will be used.
It is also possible to give custom directory by specifying command line option "-jp" (f.e: process_JSON.py -jp "C:\temp").
